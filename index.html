    const letterText = `Precious Shruv.\n\nDoes love change? Does the person you love the most ever grow stale in your eyes? I like to see this question differently. If I were to think of love, few faces come through my head. I see my parents chuckling on sight of me saying something as a kid, my grandfather playing cricket with me or feeding me ice cream while I sat on their lap. I see my Nani calling out my name.\n\nKeeping them aside a face has recently joined these collective montage of memories. That face calls herself Shruti Kondori, I call her Shru or Shruvi. She's cute, she smiles when she sees me, laughs at my shitty jokes, a great kisser, extremely emotionally intelligent, really responsible, smells nice... Everything I can dream of.\n\nEvery moment I spent with her, flies over so quickly out of hands yet everything stays with me. Little actions signify how much she cares about me and honestly I would do anything for her. Things which were mundane to me now hold deep meaning. Love felt like an amazing life changing thing that felt impossible to obtain but paradoxically so easy to be in.\n\nThe touch, a look, a smile from her is enough make drop to my knees and start thanking God for everything. I was aching for eternal belonging and I have found that in her. She sees the real me and I see her truest form. When she's resting her head on my chest I feel as if I have won the world.\n\n"I love her" feels too cliché and less powerful trying to put how much she means to me in words. My love for her only grows as each day passes. She brings out the best in me without even trying. My love for Shruti has only blossomed more ever so lovingly for her. \n\nI can't wait to be independent so I can spend my life looking after my tiny family. She's my home. She's my bliss. She's my love. I want to give her every bit of happiness in this world. I can see her smile till the end of my time. \n\nI want to keep her next to me always... together, cuddling, watching movies, going on long walks, going on drives, exercising together... I want to hold you so close because I don't want our hearts to stay away from each other. \n\nThis wouldn't end here my love. I know our stupid fates would find us together again in every life and I'll choose you each time just to do this all over again and again.`;
